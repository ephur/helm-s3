## [0.7.1]
- Fork to force region until we can do a proper work around

## [0.7.0]

### Added

- Added global `--acl` flag to address issues for setups with multiple Amazon
accounts. Thanks to [@razaj92](https://github.com/razaj92) for the Pull Request!
[Ref: [#37](https://github.com/hypnoglow/helm-s3/issues/37)]
- Added `--dry-run` flag to `helm s3 push` command. It simulates a push, but doesn't
actually touch anything. This option is useful, for example, to indicate if
a chart upload would fail due to the version not being changed.
[Ref: [#44](https://github.com/hypnoglow/helm-s3/issues/44)]
- Added `--ignore-if-exists` flag to `helm s3 push` command. It allows to exit
normally without triggering an error if the pushed chart already exists. A clean
exit code may be useful to avoid some error management in the CI/CD.
[Ref: [#41](https://github.com/hypnoglow/helm-s3/issues/41)]

### Changed

- Moved `helm s3 reindex` command out of beta, as it seems there are no more
issues related to it.
